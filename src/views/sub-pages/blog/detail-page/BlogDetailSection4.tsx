                <h3 className={classnames(styles.pb_24, 'fs_35')}>What Trails You Should Ride in Moab</h3>
                <p>Moab is saturated with great trails, and many of them can be exceptionally technical, especially for beginner riders, but there are still plenty of trails that can be fun for all skill levels. These are some of the most popular trails in the Moab area that you should aim to ride while in town but I implore anyone to explore the massive trail maps for themselves to find all the hidden gems in the area.</p>
                <h3 className={classnames(styles.py_24, 'fs_35')}>Porcupine Rim (Difficult)</h3>
                <p>One of the many great things about Moab is how much camping there is. Most of it is pretty private and much cheaper than staying in a hotel. Thanks to the abundance of public lands near Moab, there are plenty of free options, and if you don’t mind dispersed camping, this is a great option. If you want to have a few amenities, there are some great BLM campgrounds or National Park options. If you choose a BLM campground, bring plenty of extra water to cook and stay hydrated.</p>

                <p>One of the most iconic trails in the area is full of technical moves and mind-blowing views. Porcupine Rim descends for 11 miles and ticks off just over 3,000 feet of elevation drop. There are plenty of shuttle options for this iconic trail, and most shops in Moab will offer weekday and weekend shuttles. You can also make a big day of it and pedal up for the Whole Enchilada route, or you can pedal up Sand Flats Road.</p>
                <h3 className={classnames(styles.py_24, 'fs_35')}>Captain Ahab (Difficult/Extreme)</h3>

                <p>Split into two sections, Upper and Lower Ahab are located in the Amasa Back area, just outside of town. Both trails are exceptionally technical, with the lower section being the real test of skill and technical ability for advanced riders. If you want to take the mellow route, HyMasa gets you down with fewer heart-stopping features. Each section is about 2 miles in length, and if you combine them, you are looking at a 4-mile journey that drops almost 1,400 feet.</p>
                <h3 className={classnames(styles.py_24, 'fs_35')}>Slickrock (Difficult)</h3>
                <p>This is one of the most popular trails in the area. It takes you through a range of different features above the city of Moab and is an excellent introduction to riding in Moab. Approximately 10 miles and nearly 1,000 feet of up and down throughout, this is a great way to see what riding the area’s rocks is all about. Get ready for steep and punchy climbs, lots of exposure, and beautiful views.</p>

                <p>What could be considered the easy alternative to Porcupine Rim, this route connects four moderate trails, making for a 12-mile ride back to Sand Flats road and Moab proper. Shuttling this will get you almost 2,800 feet of descending with a few quick, technical climbs sprinkled in to keep you on your toes.</p>
